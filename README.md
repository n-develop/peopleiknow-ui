# People I Know-UI

This project will be the new UI layer for "People I Know" (https://github.com/n-develop/peopleiknow).
Right now, "People I Know" is a ASP.NET Core MVC application with the traditional views and some vanilla JavaScript.

This new Vue.js based project will be the new UI for "People I Know". 

To get this project running, just run `npm install` and `npm run serve`.

For production builds, `npm run build` is used.
